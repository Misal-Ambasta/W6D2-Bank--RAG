# RAG Implementation for Banking Knowledge Base using LangChain

## Q: 1

A bank needs an AI assistant to answer questions about loan products, regulatory requirements, and internal policies using a knowledge base of documents. This solution must use the LangChain framework to leverage its document processing, vector storage, and chain orchestration capabilities.

## Document Types in Knowledge Base

The system will process various banking documents, including:

- Loan handbooks with complex amortization tables
- Regulatory manuals with multi-page compliance matrices
- Policy documents mixing narrative text with structured tables
- Rate sheets with interconnected pricing tables

## Technical Requirements

**Framework:** Must use LangChain for:

- Document loading and preprocessing
- Text splitting and chunking strategies
- Vector embeddings and storage
- Retrieval chain implementation
- Prompt engineering and LLM integration

## Key RAG Challenges to Solve

- **Table Context Loss:** Chunking breaks relationships between table headers and data rows
- **Cross-Reference Failures:** "See Table 3.2" references become meaningless after chunking
- **Inconsistent Responses:** Same question yields different answers due to fragmented table data
- **Compliance Risk:** Incorrect loan terms or rates could violate banking regulations

## LangChain Components to Utilize

Your implementation should demonstrate proficiency with:

- Document Loaders (UnstructuredFileLoader, PyPDFLoader, etc.)
- Text Splitters (RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, custom splitters)
- Vector Stores (Chroma, FAISS, or Pinecone)
- Embeddings (OpenAI, HuggingFace, or similar)
- Retrieval Chains (RetrievalQA, ConversationalRetrievalChain)
- Memory for conversation context
- Custom Chains for specialized banking workflows

## Cost Optimization Considerations

**Important:** Enterprise RAG implementations can be expensive. Create a supplementary document titled "Cost-Effective RAG Implementation Guide" that analyzes:

### High-Cost Components to Optimize:

- Premium LLM APIs (GPT-4, Claude) - Primary cost driver
- Vector database hosting (Pinecone, Weaviate cloud)
- Document processing APIs (Unstructured.io, Azure Document Intelligence)
- Compute resources for embedding generation

### Cost-Effective Alternatives:

- **Local/Open-Source LLMs:** Ollama, Llama 2/3, Mistral (eliminate API costs)
- **Self-Hosted Vector DBs:** Chroma, FAISS (reduce hosting fees)
- **Batch Processing:** Process documents offline to reduce real-time costs
- **Embedding Caching:** Store embeddings to avoid recomputation
- **Tiered LLM Strategy:** Use cheaper models for simple queries, premium for complex ones

### Required Cost Analysis:

Include a breakdown comparing:

- **Premium Setup:** GPT-4 + Pinecone + cloud hosting
- **Optimized Setup:** Local Llama + Chroma + self-hosted infrastructure
- **Hybrid Approach:** Mix of local and cloud services

Estimate monthly costs for 1,000 daily queries across different scenarios.

# Cost Optimization and ROI Analysis

## 1. Cost Breakdown of Current Stack

Our current RAG pipeline uses a cost-effective, self-hosted stack:

- **Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash)**: Google's pricing is based on input/output characters. For `gemini-2.0-flash`, it's highly competitive. Let's assume an average of 2,000 input characters (context) and 500 output characters (answer) per query.
  - **Pricing**: (Check latest Google AI Platform pricing)
  - **Cost**: Low, pay-per-use.

- **Self-hosted ChromaDB**: The cost is effectively **$0** as it runs on local infrastructure. You only pay for the compute/storage resources it consumes, which are minimal for this scale.

- **MiniLM Embedding Computation**: This is a one-time, offline cost. The `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model is open-source and runs locally. The cost is the compute time for initial document embedding, which is negligible.

## 2. Comparison of RAG Stacks

| Component          | Optimized Stack (Current)      | Premium Stack                  | Hybrid Stack                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **LLM**            | Gemini 2.0 Flash               | GPT-4                          | Gemini or GPT-4 (flexible)        |
| **Vector Store**   | ChromaDB (local)               | Pinecone (managed)             | ChromaDB or Cloud Vector DB       |
| **Embeddings**     | MiniLM (local)                 | OpenAI `text-embedding-ada-002`| MiniLM or Cloud API               |
| **Cost**           | **Very Low**                   | **High**                       | **Moderate**                      |
| **Performance**    | High (fast, good quality)      | Very High (top quality)        | Tunable                           |
| **Maintenance**    | Low (self-contained)           | Very Low (fully managed)       | Moderate (depends on components)  |

## 3. Estimated Monthly Cost (1,000 Queries/Day)

- **Daily Queries**: 1,000
- **Monthly Queries**: 30,000

**Assumptions for Gemini 2.0 Flash:**
- **Avg. Input tokens per query**: ~1,500 (context + question)
- **Avg. Output tokens per query**: ~300 (answer)
- **Total tokens per query**: 1,800
- **Total monthly tokens**: 30,000 queries * 1,800 tokens/query = 54,000,000 tokens

*Note: Gemini pricing is often character-based, but token estimates are useful for comparison. Please refer to the official Google Cloud pricing for exact calculations.*

- **Estimated Gemini Cost**: This will be a few hundred dollars per month, significantly lower than premium alternatives.
- **ChromaDB/MiniLM Cost**: $0.

**Conclusion**: The current stack offers an extremely cost-effective solution, with the primary cost being Gemini API usage.

## 4. ROI Suggestions and Scaling

- **Return on Investment (ROI)**:
  - **Productivity Gains**: Reduces time for employees/customers to find information in banking documents.
  - **Accuracy**: Lowers risk of errors from misinterpretation of complex documents.
  - **Scalability**: Can handle increasing query loads with minimal infrastructure changes.

- **Scaling Scenarios**:
  - **Increased Load**: For higher query volumes, the Gemini API scales automatically. The local ChromaDB instance may need more memory/CPU, or you could migrate to a managed vector database.
  - **Higher Accuracy Needs**: For critical tasks, you could dynamically switch to a more powerful model like `gemini-pro` or `GPT-4` for specific queries, creating a hybrid cost model.
  - **Global Deployment**: Consider deploying the Streamlit app and a ChromaDB instance in a cloud environment (e.g., Google Cloud Run, AWS) for better availability and lower latency.

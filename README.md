# Banking Knowledge Base RAG Project

This project implements a full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for a banking knowledge base. It allows users to upload financial documents (PDF, DOCX, Excel) and ask questions in natural language, receiving answers generated by an AI that cites the source documents.

## Features

- **Multi-Format Document Loading**: Ingests PDF, DOCX, and Excel files.
- **Structure-Aware Chunking**: Uses `langchain-docling`'s `HybridChunker` to preserve tables and document structure.
- **Efficient Embeddings**: Employs the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model for fast, local embedding generation with caching.
- **Vector Storage**: Leverages a local ChromaDB instance for persistent, low-cost vector storage.
- **Conversational AI**: Powered by Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model via LangChain for high-quality, conversational responses.
- **Interactive UI**: A Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface for file uploads, chat, and viewing retrieved document chunks.

## Architecture

The RAG pipeline follows these steps:
1.  **Document Ingestion**: User uploads documents via the Streamlit UI.
2.  **Chunking**: Documents are loaded and parsed into structured chunks, preserving tables.
3.  **Embedding & Storage**: Text chunks are converted to vector embeddings and stored in ChromaDB.
4.  **Retrieval**: When a user asks a question, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks from ChromaDB.
5.  **Generation**: The retrieved chunks and the user's question are passed to the Gemini LLM, which generates a final answer.

For a detailed overview, see `docs/architecture.md`.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository**

2.  **Set up the environment**:
    ```bash
    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/Scripts/activate  # On Windows

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure API Keys**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Gemini API key:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your-super-secret-key
    ```

4.  **Launch the Application**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
    ```
